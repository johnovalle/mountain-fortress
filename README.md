#Black Dragon 2

Project description
-------------------
Old school dungeon crawler
This my first real attempt at a game. It's completely hand rolled in JS. For this project, I gave myself a time limit of one month. After the lessons I had learned in a previous project, [Black Dragon 1](https://github.com/kugyousha/black-dragon), I set out to expand the scope of what I was doing and make something that people would actually be able to play. The biggest challenges in this project were procedurally generating the levels of the dungeon, and animating the players and camera movement. 

Each play through is unique with the dungeon being 10 levels deep and certain items only generating on certain levels. Monsters will continuously generate outside of the player's field of vision. The only items available are those that generate with the level.
